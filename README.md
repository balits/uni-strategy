# A collection of resources about Masters programmes in Europe

I put together this list to help me in the future, when I finally gradute with Bsc in Computer Science. Below are a list of european universites, which provide a Masters Program in Computer Science or something related.

## In the future

In the future I plan to extend this list with additional link, information about requirement (GPA or cover letters), living conditions aswell as cost of living, and nearby companies or job opportunites.
